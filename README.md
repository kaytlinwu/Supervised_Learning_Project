# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
Using different supervised learning techniques, the aim is to build a machine learning model using various diagnostic measurements to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. 

The project includes initial data exploration and data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, creating 2 different models and comparing them amongst each other. The models used in this project are SVM (Support Vector Machine) along with Ensemble Modelling using ____________________________________________.

### Duration:
Approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes.

### Project Description:
In this project, supervised learning techniques were applied to the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 

The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Supervised learning: We will use the Diabetes dataset to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. We will select at least two models, including one ensemble model, and compare their performance.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."
